## Crypto Arbitrage

Welcome to my repository for Crypto Arbitrage. The purpose of this program is to illustrate arbitrage opportunites between 2 crypto currency exchanges. Using historical data we isolated 3 dates across the first quarter of 2018 in order to demonstrate the potential profits of executing a well thought out arbitrage strategy.

## Technology 

This project leverages python 3.7.9 within Jupyter Lab using the following libraries:

* Pandas

* Numpy

* Matplotlib

---

## Installation Guide

The program must be run in a Jupyter Lab setting (either in browser, or VSCode). Make sure to import the following libraries before beginning: 

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from pathlib import Path
%matplotlib inline
```

## Usage with Examples

To use the Crypto Arbitrage Program (CAP) simply:
* Clone the repository to your local computer
* From your GitBash / Terminal / Command Line launch either Jupyter Lab browser, or VSCode with Jupyter Lab enabled
* Open the **crypto_arbitrage.ipynb** and begin your **preferred user experience** within Jupyter Lab

There are several ways a user can walk through the program that are unique to your **preferred user experience**. 
1) The **data discovery** method:
* Allows the user to enter/click through the program one cell of code at a time to follow the logic and answers. 
    * There are 2 ways to accomplish the **data discovery**
        * Select the cell you want to run and hit Shift+Enter. 
        * **You must wait for the green check mark indicator before entering through the next cell**

        * Select the cell you want to run and hit the play button in the top left corner of the cell
        * **You must wait for the green check mark indicator before clicking through the next cell**

2) The **data explosion** method:
* Allows the user to run all cells consecutively then view the program in it's entirety by simply scrolling down through the program.
